# 🖼️ Image Captioning - Machine Learning - Python

![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103) 

A deep learning model that generates descriptive captions for images. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for generating captions.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an Image Captioning model using Machine Learning techniques. Given an image, the model generates a textual description of the image. 

The project is implemented using:
- 🏗 **CNN** (Pre-trained model like InceptionV3) for feature extraction.
- 📜 **RNN (LSTM)** for generating image captions.
- 📊 **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning implementation.
- 📝 **NLTK & Tokenizers** for text processing.

---

## 📌 Dataset

The model is trained on the **Flickr8k** dataset, which contains 8,000 images with five captions per image. Dataset preprocessing includes:
- Tokenization of text data
- Removing punctuation & special characters
- Creating word embeddings

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageCaptioning-MachineLearning-Python.git
   cd ImageCaptioning-MachineLearning-Python
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download and preprocess the dataset**
   ```sh
   python preprocess.py
   ```
4. **Train the model**
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
5. **Test the model**
   ```sh
   python test.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: The image is passed through a pre-trained CNN (InceptionV3) to extract feature vectors.
2. **Caption Generation**: The feature vectors are passed into an LSTM-based language model that predicts the next word sequentially.
3. **Prediction**: The final caption is generated using beam search or greedy search decoding.

## 🤖 Model Architecture

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

class ImageCaptioningModel(Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, units):
        super(ImageCaptioningModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
        self.dense = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.embedding(inputs)
        x, _, _ = self.lstm(x)
        output = self.dense(x)
        return output
```

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Enhance caption accuracy with **Transformer-based architectures** (e.g., GPT, BERT, ViT).
- Train on larger datasets like **MS COCO**.
- Deploy as a web application using **Flask/FastAPI**.
